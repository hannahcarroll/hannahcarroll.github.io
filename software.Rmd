</div>

BayClump was developed to support and facilitate the use of Bayesian models and analyses involving clumped isotope calibration datasets, and associated temperature reconstructions. BayClump is a self-contained R Shiny Dashboard application which facilitates the comparisons of Bayesian and frequentist models for analyzing clumped isotope datasets for paleoclimatic reconstructions.

# The 'bayclumpr' package for R

'bayclumpr' is an R package for simulating synthetic clumped isotope datasets, fitting linear regression models under Bayesian and non-Bayesian frameworks, and generating temperature reconstructions
